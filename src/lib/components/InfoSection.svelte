    <div class="text-lg">
        Cauda Equina Syndrome (CES) is a rare but serious medical condition that
        occurs when the nerve roots of the cauda equina, located at the base of
        the spinal cord, become compressed. This compression can result from
        various causes such as a herniated disc, spinal tumors, trauma, or
        spinal infections. Individuals with CES may experience a range of
        symptoms, including severe lower back pain, leg weakness, numbness in
        the lower extremities, and loss of bowel or bladder control. Recognizing
        these symptoms and seeking immediate medical attention is crucial, as
        CES requires prompt intervention to prevent irreversible damage to the
        nerves.
